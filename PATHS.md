# Core Course Paths

You will be going through two paths simultaneously: Math and Computer Science. You have one option for math, and three for computer science. You'll want to get started on the math right away and do it alongside the computer science. Which computer science track you go with will depend on where you're starting in math and where you're starting in computer science. 

## Math
College Algebra is equivalent to Algebra 2, Single Variable Calculus is equivalent to Calculus 1-2 or AP Calculus BC, Math for Computer Science is roughly equivalent to Discrete Math. Start wherever you are up to in your math education. The College Algebra and Pre-Calculus courses come with a sort of placement test at the starting. If you get below 15%, you're not ready for the course. If you get at least 85%, you've already learned that material and should start with the next course. With all these courses, you may need to look elsewhere for additional help learning the material. Khan Academy is pretty great for everything through Single Variable Calculus.

[ASU MAT 117 College Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/college-algebra-and-problem-solving) | 
[ASU MAT 170 PreCalculus](https://www.edx.org/course/precalculus) |
[MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/) | There's also a [paced version on edX](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-18.01x-single-variable-calculus) that runs once a year starting in the fall. You can likely learn the material faster on your own though.
[MIT 6.042J Math for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/) | Note that there's also a [2010 version](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) that's worth looking at.

## Computer Science

### WPI

[CS 1101 - Introduction to Program Design - A Term 2016](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs1101/a16/) | | The course uses selections from the first and second editions of How to Design Programs. The links to second edition are broken so you'll have to manually navigate to the appropriate section of [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/).
[CS 2102 - Object-Oriented Design Concepts - B Term 2016 - Kathi Fisler - WPI](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs2102/b16/) | [Lectures & Assignments](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs2102/b16/syllabus.html) | 
CS 2223 | | prerequisite: 6.042J Math for Computer Science;<br />Use some combination of the [D Term 2015 version](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs2223/d15/) and the [D Term 2018 version](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~heineman/html/teaching_/cs2223/d18/)

[CS 10 - The Beauty and Joy of Computing - Spring 2013](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/sp14/) | [Internet Achive](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_itunesu_805310921) | | If you've never touched code before. Any other course will do fine as well. If you've played around with code in the past (even Scratch), you can just go right to 61A.
[CS 61A - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Fall 2013](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp14/) | [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_itunesu_805311012) | | corequisite: MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus;<br />If you're using Windows, you'll want to install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) since it comes with Git Bash, an equivalent to Terminal on Linux.
[CS 61B - Data Structures and Advanced Programming - Spring 2014](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/) | [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_itunesu_915550021) | [Labs and Homework](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/hw/index.html) | 
[CS 170 - Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems - Fall 2014](http://www-inst.cs.berkeley.edu/~cs170/fa14/) | [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL-XXv-cvA_iDMQSb7I9-N4oxi0Ran2q9g) | |

[CS 61C - Machine Structures - Spring 2015 - UC Berkeley](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/) | [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_itunesu_960798612) | | In lab 0, skip step 0, skip the form, and when it tells you to add cs61c-xx, instead create a private repository on your own github account and add that.
